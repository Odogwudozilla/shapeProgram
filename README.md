# shapeProgram
I re-imagine the triangle program (initially written to pass an interview) to use OO principles, add more shapes and do more stuff.

- The user can determine the type of shape and the sub-types
- Code is written in Java
- You can run on the commandline
- You can clone the repo and make any further modifications you deem fit to the code.
